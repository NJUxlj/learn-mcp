It quantifies the likelihood of misclassifying a randomly chosen element if it were labeled according to the class distribution within a subset. Gini impurity is commonly employed to evaluate the quality of splits in decision trees, helping to select the best feature for partitioning the data. Unlike entropy, which is based on information theory, Gini impurity provides a simpler computational approach while still effectively guiding the tree-building process.
