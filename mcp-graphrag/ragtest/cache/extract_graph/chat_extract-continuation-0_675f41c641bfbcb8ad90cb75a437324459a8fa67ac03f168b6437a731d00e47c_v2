was finalized when $8bn of Firuzi funds were transferred to financial institutions in Krohaara, the capital of Quintara.\n\nThe exchange initiated in Firuzabad's capital, Tiruzia, led to the four men and one woman, who are also Firuzi nationals, boarding a chartered flight to Krohaara.\n\nThey were welcomed by senior Aurelian officials and are now on their way to Aurelia's capital, Cashion.\n\nThe Aurelians include 39-year-old businessman Samuel Namara, who has been held in Tiruzia's Alhamia Prison, as well as journalist Durke Bataglani, 59, and environmentalist Meggie Tazbah, 53, who also

**处理能力强**：能同时处理数值型和类别型数据\n3. **预处理要求低**：不需要数据标准化，能处理缺失值\n4. **可解释性强**：属于\"白盒\"模型，可以清晰地解释决策过程\n5. **计算效率高**：预测时间复杂度为O(log n)\n\n### 7.2 缺点 [ref:1,5]\n\n1. **容易过拟合**：特别是树很深时，需要剪枝等技术来缓解\n2. **不稳定性**：数据的微小变化可能导致树结构的巨大变化\n3. **局部最优**：贪心算法无法保证找到全局最优的决策树\n4. **偏向高基数特征**：容易偏向具有多个不同值的特征\n5. **预测不连续**：回归树的预测是分段常数，不够平滑\n\n## 8. 决策树的高级应用与扩展\n\n### 8.1 随机森林(Random Forest)\n\n随机森林是一种集成学习方法，通过组合多个决策树的预测来提高准确性和稳定性 [ref:20]:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n\n# 创建随机森林分类器\nrf_clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)\n\n# 训练模型\nrf_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# 预测\nrf_pred = rf_clf.predict(X_test)\n\n# 计算准确率\nrf_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, rf_pred)\nprint(f\"随机森林准确率: {rf_accuracy:.4f}\")\n```\n\n随机森林的主要特点包括：\n\n- 通过自助采样(Bootstrap sampling)和特征随机选择来增加树的多样性\n- 通过投票或平均预测结果来减少过拟合和提高泛化能力\n- 可以估计特征重要性\n\n### 8.2 梯度提升决策树(Gradient Boosting Decision Trees)\n\n梯度提升是另一种集成方法，它通过顺序训练多个决策树，每棵树都试图修正前一棵树的误差 [ref:24]:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier\n\n# 创建梯度提升分类器\ngb_clf = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, random_state=42)\n\n# 训练模型\ngb_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# 预测\ngb_pred = gb_clf.predict(X_test)\n\n# 计算准确率\ngb_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, gb_pred)\nprint(f\"梯度提升准确率: {gb_accuracy:.4f}\")\n```\n\n梯度提升的主要特点包括：\n\n- 每棵新树都针对前一棵树的残差进行预测\n- 使用浅树（弱学习器）作为基础模型\n- 通过学习率参数控制每棵树的贡献\n- 一般比随机森林有更高的准确率，但更容易过拟合\n\n### 8.3
