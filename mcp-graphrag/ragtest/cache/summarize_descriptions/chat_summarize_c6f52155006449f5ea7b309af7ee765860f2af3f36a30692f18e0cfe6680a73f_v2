It serves as a key metric for determining the optimal feature to split the data, thereby improving the tree's predictive accuracy. By measuring the disorder or randomness in the data, entropy helps identify the most informative attributes for partitioning, ensuring more effective classification or regression. Both descriptions emphasize its role as a measure of impurity, reinforcing its importance in machine learning for feature selection and dataset analysis.  \n\nIn summary, **ENTROPY** is a foundational tool in decision trees, providing a systematic way to evaluate and reduce uncertainty in datasets by guiding the splitting process.
